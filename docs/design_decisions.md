# Design Decision Log

A running record of the non-trivial choices in this thesis and *why* they were made. Update it
whenever you decide something you might be asked to defend — bit-widths, dataflow, quantization,
scope. Keep the `DD-NNN` ids sequential.

## How to add an entry
Copy the template below, give it the next id, and fill it in.

```
### DD-NNN — <short title>
- Status: Proposed | Accepted | Superseded by DD-XXX
- Date: YYYY-MM-DD
- Context: what question forced a choice.
- Decision: what you decided.
- Rationale: why, in a sentence or two.
- Alternatives considered: what you rejected, and why.
- Revisit if: the condition that would reopen this.

### DD-001 — Target platform: Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC
- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-06-06
- Context: need a platform that can hold the full MobileNetV2, load images from SD, and (later) a camera.
- Decision: Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC (ZCU / Kria / Ultra96 class).
- Rationale: enough DSP/BRAM/URAM for the full network, plus a hard ARM (PS) + DDR for image loading and orchestration, and MIPI support for the camera stretch goal.
- Alternatives considered: small Zynq-7000 (too tight for the full network); non-Zynq Artix/Kintex (no hard ARM/DDR, harder SD + camera).
- Revisit if: the specific board runs out of DSP/BRAM at synthesis (Phase 2) → reduce parallelism or tile harder.

### DD-002 — RTL language: Verilog-2001
- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-06-06
- Context: must simulate and implement in Vivado; the thesis is about hand-written RTL.
- Decision: Verilog-2001.
- Rationale: fully supported by Vivado; hand-written RTL gives the layer-level control and understanding the work is about.
- Alternatives considered: HLS / SystemVerilog — faster to write but less control, and not the hand-RTL goal.
- Revisit if: timeline pressure makes HLS worthwhile for non-critical glue logic (a scoped exception only).

### DD-003 — Reusable parameterized engines, not per-layer hardware
- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-06-06
- Context: MobileNetV2 has dozens of layers; one module per layer is infeasible in the timeframe.
- Decision: a small set of parameterized engines (1×1 conv, 3×3 depthwise, requantize+ReLU6, residual-add, bias) sequenced by a controller across all blocks.
- Rationale: write ~6 modules once and reuse them via parameters and weights — this is what makes the full network achievable.
- Alternatives considered: a fully unrolled per-layer pipeline (enormous area, infeasible).
- Revisit if: a specific layer needs a specialized datapath for performance.

### DD-004 — Tiered success criteria
- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-06-06
- Context: full network + live camera from zero in ~5.5 months is high-risk if treated as all-or-nothing.
- Decision: core = full network bit-exact in simulation, plus image-from-SD on the board; stretch = live camera.
- Rationale: guarantees a defensible result even if on-board / camera work runs late.
- Alternatives considered: aiming straight for live camera (a single point of failure).
- Revisit if: ahead of schedule by the end of Phase 4 → pull the camera work forward.

### DD-005 — Quantization scheme: int8, TFLite-style
- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-06-06
- Context: FPGA arithmetic must be integer; MobileNetV2 is sensitive to quantization, especially depthwise layers.
- Decision: int8 with **per-channel weights** and **per-tensor activations**; requantize via a fixed-point multiplier + shift; clamp to the ReLU6 range; **batch-norm folded into conv weights/bias offline**.
- Rationale: the canonical, accuracy-preserving recipe for MobileNetV2; an integer-only path maps cleanly to hardware.
- Alternatives considered: float / 16-bit fixed (more area and memory); per-tensor weights (worse depthwise accuracy).
- Revisit if: post-training quantization drops accuracy too far → switch to quantization-aware training.

### DD-006 — Verification by golden vectors (bit-exact, layer by layer)
- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-06-06
- Context: need an objective, incremental way to confirm the hardware is correct.
- Decision: the software int8 model emits the exact integer output of every layer; each RTL block and the full network are checked against these bit-for-bit.
- Rationale: removes guesswork, localizes bugs to a single layer, and provides the thesis's hardware-vs-software comparison.
- Alternatives considered: comparing only final accuracy (hides per-layer bugs, hard to debug).
- Revisit if: never — this is the backbone. Extend it as layers are added.

### DD-007 — Memory & dataflow: weights in DDR, activations on-chip
- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-06-06
- Context: ~3.4M parameters will not fit on-chip; activations can.
- Decision: stream weights from DDR over AXI4 (HP ports) + DMA; keep activations in BRAM/URAM with tiling.
- Rationale: matches the paper's memory-efficient inference (≤ ~400K activations to materialize at once) and avoids heavy off-chip activation traffic.
- Alternatives considered: all-on-chip weights (won't fit); all-off-chip activations (bandwidth-bound).
- Revisit if: a layer's activation tile exceeds on-chip capacity → add activation streaming for that layer.

bit-widths, the PE-array dimensions, on-chip buffer sizes, AXI burst lengths, and the layer-scheduling order.
