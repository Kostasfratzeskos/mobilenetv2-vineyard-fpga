# Lab Notebook

A lightweight log of what you did, what broke, and what's next. One short entry per work session
keeps momentum and makes the methodology chapter far easier to write later.

### 2026-06-06 — Project kickoff
- Did: set up the repo scaffold, the plan, and the design-decision log (DD-001–007).
- Found / decided: tiered scope locked; verification will run on golden vectors.
- Blocked on: nothing.
- Next: install Vivado/Vitis, boot the board, read a file from SD (Phase 0); email field contacts for real vine images.


### 2026-06-07 — Chose the fixed-point format
- Did: Made a scheme with the dataflow of bits through a layer
- Found / decided: 8-bit data width (int8 quantization)
- Blocked on: nothing
- Next: Send to Konstantinos for the images and start implementing the MobileNet-V2 in python

### 2026-06-07 — Contact with Konstantinos and started model training
- Did: I spoke with Konstantinos and started model training with the help of claude (float32 training)
- Found / decided: 
- Blocked on: nothing
- Next: Build the model for int8 operations.

### 2026-06-08 - Model Evaluation
- Did: Completed float model training and the evaluation of the model
- Found / decided: 
    Overall accuracy: 1.0000 (4062/4062)
    Per-class accuracy:
    black_rot            1.0000  (n=1180)
    esca                 1.0000  (n=1383)
    healthy              1.0000  (n=423)
    leaf_blight          1.0000  (n=1076)
- Blocked on: nothing
- Next: Build the model for int8 operations.

### 2026-06-11 - Building the int8 Model
- Did: Claude created the quantize.py file that does the training in int8 quantization
- Found / decided: 
   INT8   val acc: 100.00%   (drop +0.00 pts)
   black_rot    100.0%
   esca         100.0%
   healthy      100.0%
   leaf_blight  100.0%

wrote quant_scales.json  (53 layers)
- Blocked on: nothing
- Next: Continue with exporting the golden vectors from the reference model

### 2026-06-13 - Understanding quantization and build of export.py
- Did: I watched a video that explained quantization in cnns and understood what the claude build for phase 2.
- Found / decided: exported int8 weights, int32 bias, int8 M0 variables, golden vectors for each layer.
- Blocked on: nothing
- Next: Build the axi4 light stream, just to transfer some data from PS to PL.

### 2026-06-18 - Understanding phase 2 in process
- Did: I tried to wrote everything i have understood from phase 1 and 2 in phase2_export_.. file.
- Found / decided: --
- Blocked on: nothing
- Next: Build the axi4 light stream, just to transfer some data from PS to PL.

### 2026-06-20 - C implemantation of the model int8 pipeline
- Did: I fixed the make in my environment, I began to study a c implemantation of a simple cnn
- Found / decided: The c implemantation will help me understand better the whole model.
- Blocked on: nothing
- Next: Continue with the study.
